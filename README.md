# Opinion Polls Russian Federation

(inspired by:  NFKRZ youTube channel : https://www.youtube.com/c/MultiNfz , youTube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQCNjIHeqU )

## Question: ‘What can be inferred from opinion polls?’
I selected a number of opinion polls results since the formation of the Russian Federation (1991), and matched them to a number of economic, social indicators; in addition, I paid special attention to legislative changes aimed at managing the information flow that have been occurring in the Federation since the early 2000s. These form the parameters as well as the limitations of this study.

All the opinion polls results have been sourced from the Levada Center, the Levada Center is a Russian independent, non-governmental polling and sociological research organization; the economic and social data has been sourced from Fred (Federal Reserve Economic Data),  and the World Bank. All resources used are listed in the ‘References’ section, the code used to scrap and process the data is available in 2 Notebooks. 

### Approval of the Presidency and the Government

Monthly approval ratings for the Presidency are high; the approval ratings for the Government are not as high but still very good, and loosely follow the trends of the presidency approval ratings. 
The lowest approval for a president of the Russian Federation was in August 1999, the President was Mr Yeltsin, who resigned the following December. 
Mr Putin, who succeeded him in 2000, has enjoyed high popular approval since taking the presidency, the highest he ever achieved was 89/100, in June 2015. However since then, approval of Mr. Putin has been in decline (see yearly medians, graph below); the lowest it has ever been was on the eve of proposed changes to the Russian Constitution, the changes would enable Mr.Putin to run for another term in office, these changes were put to the population in a referendum and passed. 

Since the heights of 2015, the approval ratings for both the Presidency and the Government have been declining, however the downward trend dramatically reversed direction at the beginning of 2022.

#### ‘Possible reasons for the high approval ratings’
Under the stewardship of Mr Putin, the standard of living for many Russians has improved; 
poverty,  income and wealth inequality have been decreasing (Gini Index: ‘https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient’ ); 
the health of the nation has been improving, as suggested by the reduction in alcohol consumption and increasing spending  on the health sector;
personal safety has improved too, as suggested by the decrease in homicides (Intentional homicides (per 100,000 people) rate , https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5)

### Assessment of the situation in the country, present and near future
#### Q: “Is Russia moving in the right direction or is this course a dead-end?” 

Russians felt most positive about the way the country was progressing in 2007/2008, 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339806-0d032732-f23c-4cc6-8a23-951624d88a06.jpg)

Between 2006 and 2007  the country's GDP had grown at  8.2% and 8.5%  in 2006 and 2007 respectively. (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339793-ac8f147c-9379-42cb-9fa6-5fb6c7007708.jpg)

  
The optimism implied in the responses to the question:’Is Russia moving in the right direction ?’ , is echoed in the ‘Social Sentiment Index’  

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339785-34b9c51f-5a35-4dfa-b2fe-4b023ad9bf02.jpg)

In  2007 the index consistently reached the mid 80s and above, peaking at 100 in early 2008.

Although, the SSI methodology has a range of 0 to 200,
>“...SSI varies in the range from 0 to 200, where values below 100 indicate the prevalence of negative appraisals among the public. “ (‘https://www.levada.ru>/en/social-sentiment-index/)

However, in my opinion, and only based on a very limited personal experience, if one carries even just a sliver of the slavic soul, a score of 100 out of 200 is ‘as good as it gets’. 

The downward trend in both the Social Sentiment Index and responses to the question “Is Russia moving in the right direction?” turned upwards in 2022; SSI has scored 90 and above since March, and for “Russia is moving in the right direction” the score range  is 66-69. 

### Attitudes towards the EU and the USA
Attitudes towards the EU and the USA had been overall positive since the early 2000s, even if an emerging downward trend can be noticed; they declined once the 2008 Recession hit Russia, and although they recovered since, there was a sharper decline when sanctions were imposed on the Russian Federation after the first ‘military operation’ in Ukraine in 2014. Up to the beginning of this year positive attitudes towards both the EU and the USA had been raising, to decline again after the second, and current, ‘military operation’ in Ukraine. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339780-6b2bc192-7f78-4a0e-9c96-ffa2663dd474.jpg)

Although economic and political reasons can be sighted for the sharp declines in attitudes towards the USA and the EU, the overall decline could also be attributed to a growing disillusionment with the ‘Western Model’; drawing parallels with the Soviet era , 

> “When the Red Project inspired all citizens of the country, when faith in the bright future that they build with their own hands was unshakable, the country had amazing achievements…[as the] 'Red Project' began to (..) lose its attractiveness it revealed the emptiness and absence meanings” (V.N. SHEVCHENKO. ‘To discussions around the topic "The collapse of Russia", pg. 17-18) 

Stretching the parallel, the enthusiasm for the USA and EU models may be fading because they fail to provide the 
>“higher meanings that could unite [the] Russian people” (V.N. SHEVCHENKO. ‘To discussions around the topic "The collapse of Russia", pg. 18). 

#### Putting it all together
The following graph is designed to highlight trends in  responses, 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339801-cd84c8be-1dbe-4e56-9ac1-f1907d971593.jpg)

The overall picture is of stability, consensus and widespread approval of the country’s institutions and the people at the helm.

#### Dissonance
 *'All that glitters is not gold'* (The Merchant of Venice)

The data from the World Bank suggests that under the stewardship of Mr Putin the state has delivered improvements in security, health and wealth for Russians. 

A large part of the Russian State income depends on the selling of commodities and the tax revenue these generate. Here, I have sampled only three, Brent Oil prices in the EU markets, Natural Gas Prices EU markets ( the EU as whole,  is a lucrative market for Russia with low delivery costs due to proximity and well established infrastructure and logistics) , and wheat (Russia is the largest exporter of wheat , followed by USA and Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wheat_exports)).

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339791-418e9677-2bb6-4e69-a8a8-3bfa1f11e6a9.jpg)

Gas and oil prices have been declining in recent years, which would have had a negative impact on the state revenue and ability to fund itself and invest in infrastructure  and social programmes. In addition the  strength of the Ruble against the Dollar has been declining, which has a negative impact on standards of living  in a country, such as Russia, that depend on imports of many manufactured goods (list of top Russia imports : https://oec.world/en/profile/country/rus).


The results of the opinion polls point at a high level of consensus in the country, however  there have been a number of domestic terror incidents. 
![alt text](![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185408797-811d72bb-423b-49b4-bbe5-b0fcd2226f99.png)

In addition, the Russian Federation has been involved in a number of conflicts since its formation, especially with neighboring countries and ex soviet states. 
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339790-4bc11671-c70e-4370-8e36-d160a053ac81.jpg)


Terrorist incidents and conflicts, although may intially spurr the population to rally around the central government, this support tends to fade overtime and may give way to dissatisfaction with the ability of the state to prevent terror attacks, or, in the case of ongoing conflicts, with the econimic and human costs of these military operations. 

Personal security in the country has improved greatly, as suggested by the sharp decline in homicides, independent journalists have benefitted from this trend too, but perhaps not as much as the rest of the population,
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339799-5d07e575-329c-48a6-8332-4783728c9ef9.jpg)

Legislation began to be passed in the 2000’s, aimed at ‘suppressing or prohibiting information that is considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security’.

In  order to visualize the legislative activity and events related to the implementation of these new laws, I have devised an arbitrary score for it ( see Notedbook and Notes on Methodology section below), 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339636-cb26d35e-37ac-4257-8441-13922e7e09b4.jpg)

The amount of resources invested in controlling ‘flow and access to information’, seems somewhat excessive in a country with such high levels of approval of the state.
Note:
> In 2022 jail sentences were introduced for breaching the law(No.32-FZ, 62-FZ)(See : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_2022_war_censorship_laws )

Looking again at the overall graph for the Levada Center opinion polls results and adding to it the change in laws and regulation surrounding access to and dissemination of  information, 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39082620/185339803-52740da1-b036-418f-84e7-f6b5d223c639.jpg)

Opinion polls have consistently returned high levels of approval of the way the country is being governed, nonetheless, the Russian Government has felt the need to invest an ever increasing amount of resources  in  controlling all forms of media. 

#### Anecdote (Speculation)

> “Between 1991 and 2008, the share of Russian adults identifying as Orthodox Christian rose from 31% to 72%, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of three waves of data..” (https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2014/02/10/russians-return-to-religion-but-not-to-church/)

Formation of the Russian Federation: December 25, 1991 - freedom of worship enshrined in the constitution.

Although many factors may have contributed to the increase in religious affiliation, I would suggest that unless Russia, after 1991 experienced one of the fastest conversion rates since the invention of religion, one may suspect that on occasion respondents may give the answer they believe is expected rather than the one they believe in.

If the above is accepted, then the leaders of the Russian Federation may feel that opinion polls are good for reassuring Russians of high levels of unity and consensus in the country, but may not necessarily interpret them as true reflection of the mood of the country, even when the opinion polls are conducted by an independent organization, such as the Levada Center. 

#### Censorship and Nation Building

Definition of Censorship: 
> “The suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.” (source: Oxford Languages and Google)

The management of culture as part of  Nation Building :
By promoting ‘any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered pure and decent, politically acceptable, or assure security ’ a unified, consistent, cultural and social  message is created that ensures continuity and unity in a people, and in the process helps to form/reinforce a super-identity for the nation. 

Or, by using the definition of censorship in its simplest form:
“Suppressing or prohibiting any parts of books, films, news, etc. that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security.”

**Hypothesis**: “Governments tend to be reactive, in other words they are into firefighting not fire prevention”
If this hypothesis is accepted, then, I would argue that a sufficient number of political leaders in the country believe that there is a need to carefully manage access to and prevent the broadcasting of information that can be perceived as undermining the unity and integrity of the Russian state.
> “Preserving the integrity of modern Russia is one of the most significant imperatives of the current situation that the country is going through.”(V.N. SHEVCHENKO. ‘To discussions around the topic "The collapse of Russia" ‘,В.Н. ШЕВЧЕНКО. К дискуссиям вокруг темы «Распад России» RJPS_2015-02_Shevchenko%20.pdf)

This is not peculiar to Russia, the government of every country is engaged in activities aimed at preserving/building unity, as it is a fundamental necessity to the continued existence of any nation. (Please note that in liberal democracies the state vies for support in the public arena and pursuing punitive measures to gain dominance is frowned upon).

Russia is a vast country spanning continents, populated by a myriad of ethnic groups. Against such a background, the building and maintaining of a national idea, and identity  becomes a mammoth task, which depends on social relations, and material and immaterial cultural artifacts that have to be espoused by peoples with extremely diverse ethnicity, religious affiliations and heritage, who are dispersed across a just as geographically diverse country.
> “The modern Russian centralized state, if it wants to be effective, must not only reproduce to some extent all the properties of a centralized power structure and economy, but also have a powerfully expressed spiritual and moral idea. “(pg.14 (V.N. SHEVCHENKO. ‘To discussions around the topic "The collapse of Russia")

If the above hypothesis is accepted, then measures taken by the Russian State that come under the umbrella term of ‘censorship’, could be re-interpreted as steps in the ‘Forging of the Russian Federation’. Additionally, if Shevchenko’s view that an effective Russian state must have a ‘powerfully expressed spiritual and moral idea’ is shared by the Russian ledership, then this idea must inform both domestic and foreign policy.

### Final Notes
Looking at the way responses change overtime, in conjunction with a number of economic, social indicators, and legislative changes can help in gaining a deeper understanding of the evolving situation in the country.
The opinion poll results seem to be at odds with the quality and volume of legislative changes implemented since the early 2000s, which might point to a disconnect between the State and the People, or, perhaps, a certain amount of mistrust of each other. Additionally, I might further suggest that the self-assuredness  of the government is inversely proportional to the amount of governmental intervention in the field of  ‘cultural management’. Mistrust, uncertainty, concerns with regards to stability, unity and longevity are not unusual especially in young nations, Russia is old, but the Russian Federation is only about 31 years old, in terms of the life of a nation this is very young.
Here, I have concentrated on the ‘cultural management’ occurring in the country as an additional variable in shaping the opinion polls results; I have relied heavily on Shevchenko’s article to understand at least some of the possible reasons behind this, increasingly intense, ‘cultural management’, however other insights or interpretations are perfectly possible and valid. 

Note of Caution: This piece was the result of my desire to gain a better understanding of the current situation and some of the drivers behind it, and although I have tried to keep my own biases at bay, ultimately they inform what I choose to investigate and include in this work. 

Notes on Methodology
Calculation of the arbitrary score:

I extracted the dates of key events listed in the wikipedia pages:
###### *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Russia* 
###### *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_websites_blocked_in_Russia*

###### *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_anti-war_protests_in_Russia"*

I summed occurrences of key events then selected a number of key words and assigned them a value. To decide on the value, I used the following saying:

> “Строгость российских законов смягчается необязательностью их исполнения(Ru.m.wikipedia.org) 

> “The severity of Russian laws is alleviated by the lack of obligation to fulfill them” (Translation kindly provided by Setarko), 

Therefore by extension, although the passing of a new law or amendment may be noted (score=1), it will have little impact, until a very visible implementation, in the form of, for example, a jail sentence, occurs (score=2). 
Please see Notebook for details of the calculation.
